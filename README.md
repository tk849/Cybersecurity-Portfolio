# 🌐 Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio  

Hi, I am Thabiso Kevin Dzveta, an aspiring cybersecurity professional passionate about offensive and defensive security. This repository serves as a curated collection of my hands-on projects, where I explore real-world vulnerabilities, develop mitigation strategies, and hone my technical skills—all within ethical and legal boundaries.  

## What You'll Find Here  

Each project in this portfolio is designed to:  
- **Simulate authentic threats** (e.g., misconfigured FTP servers, vulnerable web apps)  
- **Demonstrate end-to-end analysis**—from reconnaissance to remediation  
- **Align with industry frameworks** like MITRE ATT&CK and NIST  

### Featured Work Includes:  
- 🔍 **Network vulnerability assessments** using Shodan/Nmap  
- 🕵️ **Web app penetration testing** with OWASP ZAP  
- 📊 **SIEM deployment and log analysis** via ELK Stack  
- 🛡️ **Defensive strategies** (firewall rules, password hardening)  

## Why This Matters  
In today’s threat landscape, practical skills are paramount. This portfolio reflects my commitment to:  
✅ **Ethical rigor**: All testing targets self-hosted labs or authorized systems.  
✅ **Reproducible methodologies**: Clear documentation for peer review.  
✅ **Continuous learning**: Projects evolve with emerging threats (e.g., cloud security).
